Combining the concepts of scoping reviews (PMID <a href="https://pubmed.gov/20854677,25034198">20854677,25034198</a>) with Agile programming, you can have preliminary forest plots on your public website quickly to help yourself and collaborators design your formal lit search and analyses. By taking advantage of existing systematic reviews and cited reference searching, your lit search is quicker than in other methods of executing meta-analyses.

<h3>If you are not familiar with using repositories at GitHub</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Create your GitHub account</li>
	<li>If you would like to start a new review, feel free to contact <a href="mailto:rbadgett@kumc.edu">rbadgett@kumc.edu</a> with topic and GitHub user name</li>
</ul>

<h3>If you have created repositories at GitHub before</h3>
<div>Find an existing openMetaAnalysis review this is the most similar to what you want. Copy the url of the review. For example:</div>
<ul>
	<li><a href="https://github.com/new/import">Import a new repository</a> for interventions from <a href="https://github.com/openMetaAnalysis/Template-a-full-living-systematic-review-of-interventions">Template for interventions</a></li>
</ul>

<h3>After your website is ready</h3>
<div>Overview: using methods of scoping review (PMID <a href="https://pubmed.gov/20854677,25034198">20854677,25034198</a>), consider:</div>
<ul>
	<li>Creating preliminary meta-analysis with the studies you already have in hand. Usually, you already know 1-2 studies that brought the topic to your attention. You can more easily find more studies from UpToDate, Dynamed, 1-2 recent reviews (preferably systematic reviews) of your topic, the the references of included studies.</li>
	<li>Assess the initial results and their heterogeneity</li>
	<li>Determine your precise study inclusion criteria and outcomes to study
	<li>Do your formal meta-anaylses and formal lit search and execute subgroups, metaregression, and network meta-analyses that are clinically sensible as needed to address heterogeneity.</li>
</ul>

<div>Details for preliminary meta-analysis (refer to <a href="https://openmetaanalysis.github.io/methods.html">detailed methods</a> as needed)</div>
<ol>
	<li>Complete the reconciliation of studies table (see link  at your website) to document your work using the study sources above</li>
	<li>With the studies that you plan to include at this topic, complete the PICO table, Risk of Bias Table, Data spreadsheet
	<ul><li>Do this by downloading the files you need from your website, update them on your computer, then upload to your website</li></ul>
	</li>
	<li>Make your first forest plot.Note the heterogeneity - is it less than 40% ('might not be important' per the <a href="http://handbook-5-1.cochrane.org/chapter_9/9_5_2_identifying_and_measuring_heterogeneity.htm">Cochrane methods)</a>
	<ul><li>Do this by downloading the files you need from your website, update them on your computer, then upload to your website</li></ul>
	</li>
	<li>This is a good time to pause and vet your initial work at local research meetings for your institution and region</li>
</ol>

<div>Details for formal meta-analysis (refer to <a href="https://openmetaanalysis.github.io/methods.html">detailed methods</a> as needed)</div>
<ul>
	<li>For lit search, start with your reconciliation of studies table, collect the PMIDs of included studies</li>
	<li>See your web page that summarizes your lit search, and create Boolean, vector, and cited reference searches with the PMIDs of the studies already in hand</li>
	<li>Add searches of ClinicalTrials.gov and Cochrane's Central</li>
	<li>Add Repeat the methods of your preliminary analysis - now with attention to which studies to include and which outcome measures to study</li>
	<li>Add PRISMA documentation</li>
	<li>Add Reconciliation of conclusions table</li>
	<li>Add GRADE assessment</li>
</ul>
